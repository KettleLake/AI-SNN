## AI SNN
### or Artificial Intelligence Stuttering Neural Network
Is a Project I have been wanting to do in my entire life;
it will (or, more specifically `it's goal is to`) Help those who stutters, Like myself.


### How?
- Good question. My first question was exactly that. "How?!"

- Will continue adding soon.



## Why make this repo?
- Q) Excluding it will help stuttering?

- A) This whole "thing" called Stuttering; needs to be more researched in my opinion.
